# The name for this shape
Name=Standard

# GateShape= needs a newline after it before starting the shape
# Acceptable blocks are:
#    [A] = Air
#    [O] = Obsidian
#    [P] = Air blocks that will turn into the portal material when activated.
#    Extra parameters:
#    [L] = Block that will light when gate is activated
#    [S] = Block where the name sign will be created. This is optional.
#    [E] = Block from where the the teleport-in location starts from.
#			The program goes one block in the direction the gate faces and then up until it hits air.
#			This means your exit will be 1 block forward from where it is on the diagram. (and up until it hits air).
#	 The bare minimum for a gate that goes in and out would probably be something like this:
#    [P]
#    [P]
#    [O:E]
#
#    You could have a gate like this for only incoming wormholes (as there is no material to go out of).
#    You would need to create a DHD to make the gate and then remove it afterwards.
#	 [O:E]

# These values are the relative positions of the button to the lower right corner of the design.
# In the standard gate the corner is 1 down (-1 up) from the button, 1 to the right of the button, and 4 away.
